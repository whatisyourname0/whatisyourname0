Welcome to my personal Github Repository! <br/>
My real name is Joon Ho Lee, and I live in Seoul, Korea, and undergraduate student in Yonsei University. My Career goal is to be an expert in Web Programming & front-end engineering, but my ultimate end is to be an end-to-end programmer. <br />
My major is EEE, and I did my studies and projects in various languages. You can check out other repos I built! <br />
I am truly self-motivated, and I expanded and will expand my limits in every way I can take, and possibilities I can enjoy and immerse. <br />
